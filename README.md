# cloud_tools
Contains useful scripts for setting up Docker, a Dockerised Python development environment and a Dockerised Metabase app.

The scripts in this repo are for personal use and probably aren't very useful to others, at least not in the sense that they can be run as is to set up the tools mentioned.
The scripts form the basis for setting up Python and Metabase on new servers, but should be read and edited before use.
